# Bubble Sort Visualization

This Python script visualizes the bubble sort algorithm using a bar chart. The data is sorted in real-time, allowing you to see how bubble sort works step by step.

## Functions

- `update_bar(bars,colors)`: Updates the color of the bars in the bar chart.
- `bubble_sort(x,draw ,delay)`: Implements the bubble sort algorithm. It sorts the data and updates the bar chart at each step.
- `generate_data(size)`: Generates a list of random integers.
- `main()`: The main function. It generates the data, creates the bar chart, and starts the sorting process.

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment with matplotlib, numpy, and matplotlib.animation installed. The script will generate a bar chart with random data and then sort the data using bubble sort. The sorting process is animated so you can see how bubble sort works step by step.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- matplotlib
- numpy
- matplotlib.animation
